# jq-ui-bootstrap project makeover

New project organization attempt of JQuery UI Bootstrap project. Will attempt to use github infrastructure features for [JQuery UI bootstrap](https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-ui-bootstrap) project.

## Planned features:

 * Will have a dedicated gh-pages branch and master branches. 
 * Master branch will hold the "source" of the css files only, while the gh-pages branch will have the example pages.
 * There will also be a distribution in form of zip file with only css files..

## Tools integration:
 * Planning to integrate Node based express server to quickly run the pages, Grunt, Jekyll, etc.
 * The less themes will be swipable via simple javascript. So the same text content can use multiple CSS files.
